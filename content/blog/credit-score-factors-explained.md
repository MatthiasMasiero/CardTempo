## What is a Credit Score?

A credit score is a three-digit number (typically 300-850) that represents your creditworthiness - how likely you are to repay borrowed money.

The most common scoring model is **FICO Score**, used by 90% of lenders. It's calculated using five main factors from your credit report.

**Why it matters:**
- Determines loan approval (mortgage, auto, personal)
- Sets your interest rates (can save/cost you tens of thousands)
- Affects credit card approvals and limits
- Sometimes impacts insurance rates and job applications

**Score ranges:**
- **800-850:** Exceptional (top 20%)
- **740-799:** Very Good (top 40%)
- **670-739:** Good (average)
- **580-669:** Fair (below average)
- **300-579:** Poor (high risk)

## The 5 Factors That Determine Your Credit Score

### 1. Payment History (35% of Your Score)

**What it is:** Your track record of paying bills on time.

**Why it's #1:** Lenders care most about whether you actually pay what you owe. Past behavior predicts future behavior.

**What counts:**
- ✅ On-time payments (helps score)
- ❌ Late payments (30, 60, 90+ days)
- ❌ Accounts sent to collections
- ❌ Bankruptcies
- ❌ Foreclosures
- ❌ Charge-offs

**Impact by lateness:**
- **30 days late:** -60 to -110 points
- **60 days late:** -70 to -130 points
- **90+ days late:** -80 to -150 points
- **Collections:** -100 to -150 points

**How long it hurts:**
- Late payments: 7 years (impact fades over time)
- Collections: 7 years
- Bankruptcy: 7-10 years
- **But:** Recent history matters most. A 2-year-old late payment hurts less than a recent one.

**How to optimize:**

✅ **Set up autopay** on all accounts for at least the minimum payment (your safety net)

✅ **Pay before due date**, not on it (processing delays can cause "late" status)

✅ **Use calendar reminders** if you pay manually

✅ **Request goodwill adjustments** for isolated late payments (if you have good history otherwise)

**Sample goodwill letter:**
> "I've been a loyal customer for 5 years and this was my first late payment. It was due to [reason]. I've since set up autopay to prevent this. Would you consider removing this late payment as a one-time courtesy?"

**Success rate:** 20-40% for first-time late payments with otherwise good history

**Reality check:** You can't undo late payments quickly, but you can prevent future ones (which is equally important).

### 2. Credit Utilization (30% of Your Score)

**What it is:** The percentage of your available credit that you're using.

**Why it matters:** High utilization suggests you're overextended financially or depend heavily on credit.

**How it's calculated:**

**Per-card utilization:**
```
Card Balance / Card Limit × 100 = Utilization %
```

**Overall utilization:**
```
Total Balances / Total Limits × 100 = Utilization %
```

**Both matter!** Maxing out one card hurts your score even if overall utilization is low.

**Impact on score:**

| Utilization | Score Impact | Example |
|-------------|--------------|---------|
| 0-9% | Optimal | 800-850 range |
| 10-29% | Good | 740-799 range |
| 30-49% | Fair | -40 to -70 pts |
| 50-74% | Poor | -70 to -100 pts |
| 75-100% | Very Poor | -100 to -150 pts |

**The magic numbers:**
- **Under 30%** = Won't hurt you significantly
- **Under 10%** = Sweet spot for high scores
- **1-3%** = Surprisingly, slightly better than 0%

**Why 0% isn't optimal:**
Credit scoring models want to see you **actively using credit responsibly**. Having small balances (under 10%) shows you use credit but don't depend on it.

**When it's calculated:**
This is the critical detail most people miss:

❌ **NOT on your due date**
✅ **On your statement closing date**

Your card issuer reports your balance to credit bureaus on your statement closing date (usually 21-25 days before your due date).

**Example:**
- Statement closes: January 15
- Balance on Jan 15: $3,000 → **This is what gets reported**
- Due date: February 5
- You pay $3,000 in full by Feb 5 → No interest, but 30% utilization already reported

**The fix:**
Pay your balance down **BEFORE the statement closing date** to report lower utilization.

**How to optimize:**

✅ **Pay before closing date** (not just due date)

✅ **Keep overall utilization under 10%** for best scores

✅ **Keep each card under 30%** (ideally under 10%)

✅ **Request credit limit increases** (instant utilization drop)

✅ **Open new cards** strategically (increases total available credit)

✅ **Don't close old cards** (reduces total available credit)

**Fastest score boost:**
Going from 50% utilization to 10% can increase your score **40-100 points in 30 days**. This is the quickest win.

### 3. Length of Credit History (15% of Your Score)

**What it is:** How long you've had credit accounts.

**What's measured:**
- Age of oldest account
- Age of newest account
- **Average age of all accounts** (most important)

**Why it matters:** Longer history gives lenders more data to assess your reliability.

**Typical impact:**

| Average Age | Score Impact |
|-------------|--------------|
| 10+ years | Optimal |
| 7-10 years | Very Good |
| 4-7 years | Good |
| 2-4 years | Fair |
| Under 2 years | Poor (limited) |

**How new accounts affect it:**

Opening a new card immediately lowers your average age.

**Example:**
- Card A: 10 years old
- Card B: 5 years old
- Card C: 3 years old
- **Average age:** 6 years

**Open new card:**
- Card D: 0 years old
- **New average age:** 4.5 years ❌ (dropped 1.5 years)
- **Score impact:** -10 to -20 points temporarily

**Good news:** Impact is usually temporary. After 6-12 months, the benefits of the new card (higher credit limit, lower utilization) often outweigh the age penalty.

**How to optimize:**

✅ **Keep your oldest card open forever** (even if you don't use it)

✅ **Become an authorized user** on an old account (instantly adds age to your report)

✅ **Don't open cards frivolously** (each one lowers average age)

✅ **Keep cards you regret opening** for at least 2 years before closing

✅ **Make small charges on old cards** to prevent issuer from closing due to inactivity

**Authorized user hack:**
If your parent has a 15-year-old card, becoming an authorized user adds that 15-year history to your report. This can increase your average age by **years instantly**.

**Reality check:** You can't speed up time, but you can avoid hurting yourself by closing old accounts.

### 4. Credit Mix (10% of Your Score)

**What it is:** The variety of credit types in your file.

**Types of credit:**

**Revolving credit:**
- Credit cards
- Home equity lines of credit (HELOCs)
- Personal lines of credit

**Installment credit:**
- Auto loans
- Mortgages
- Student loans
- Personal loans

**Why it matters:** Successfully managing different types of credit shows financial sophistication.

**Optimal mix:**
- 2-4 credit cards (revolving)
- 1-2 installment loans (mortgage, auto, student loan)

**Impact on score:**

| Credit Mix | Score Impact |
|------------|--------------|
| Cards + installment loans | Optimal |
| Only cards (no loans) | -10 to -20 points |
| Only loans (no cards) | -10 to -20 points |
| Very thin file (1-2 accounts) | -20 to -40 points |

**How to optimize:**

✅ **If you only have cards:** Consider a credit builder loan (small cost, builds mix)

✅ **If you only have loans:** Get 1-2 credit cards (start with secured card if needed)

✅ **Don't take out loans just for mix** (only if you need them anyway)

✅ **Use credit-builder loans** as a safe way to add installment history

**Reality check:** This is the smallest major factor (10%). Don't stress about it unless you have only one type of credit.

### 5. New Credit Inquiries (10% of Your Score)

**What it is:** Recent applications for new credit.

**Two types of inquiries:**

**Hard inquiries (hurt score):**
- Credit card applications
- Loan applications
- Mortgage applications
- Auto loan applications
- Apartment applications (sometimes)

**Soft inquiries (DON'T hurt score):**
- Checking your own credit
- Pre-qualification offers
- Employer background checks
- Insurance quotes

**Impact:**
- Each hard inquiry: **-5 to -10 points**
- Stays on report: **2 years**
- Impacts score: **~12 months** (fades over time)

**Special rule: Rate shopping window**

Multiple inquiries for the same type of loan within 14-45 days count as **one inquiry**.

**Example:**
- You apply to 5 mortgage lenders in 30 days
- FICO counts this as **1 inquiry** (not 5)
- Score impact: -5 points (not -25)

**This applies to:**
- Mortgages
- Auto loans
- Student loans

**Doesn't apply to:**
- Credit cards (each application = separate inquiry)

**How to optimize:**

✅ **Check pre-qualification first** (soft inquiry, no score impact)

✅ **Space out credit card applications** (minimum 3 months apart, ideally 6)

✅ **Rate shop for loans within 14-45 days** (counts as one inquiry)

✅ **Avoid applying when score is borderline** (wait until you're safely in approval range)

✅ **Use authorized user strategy** instead of opening new accounts (no inquiry)

**Reality check:** Inquiries are the least important factor. If you need credit and qualify, don't avoid applying just because of a 5-point temporary ding.

## How the Factors Work Together

Your score is **not** a simple average. FICO's algorithm is complex, but here's a simplified example:

**Person A:**
- Payment history: Perfect (100/100 points)
- Utilization: 45% (60/100 points) ❌
- Age: 8 years (80/100 points)
- Mix: Cards + auto loan (90/100 points)
- Inquiries: 2 recent (90/100 points)
- **Estimated score: ~680**

**Person B:**
- Payment history: Perfect (100/100 points)
- Utilization: 8% (98/100 points) ✅
- Age: 8 years (80/100 points)
- Mix: Cards + auto loan (90/100 points)
- Inquiries: 2 recent (90/100 points)
- **Estimated score: ~750**

**Only difference:** Utilization
**Score difference:** 70 points

This shows why **utilization optimization gives the fastest results** - it's heavily weighted and easy to change.

## Quick-Win Factors vs Long-Term Factors

### Can Improve Quickly (30-90 days):
1. **Credit utilization** ← Focus here first
2. **New inquiries** (stop applying)
3. **Dispute errors**

### Take Time to Build:
1. **Payment history** (7 years to recover from late payment)
2. **Credit age** (can't speed up time)
3. **Credit mix** (6-12 months to see impact)

**Strategy:** Maximize quick wins while being patient with long-term factors.

## What Doesn't Affect Your Credit Score

Common myths:

❌ **Your income** (not reported to credit bureaus)
❌ **Your job** (not in FICO calculation)
❌ **Checking your own credit** (soft inquiry)
❌ **Getting pre-qualified** (soft inquiry)
❌ **Debit card usage** (not credit)
❌ **Utility/phone bills** (unless sent to collections)
❌ **Rent payments** (unless using rent-reporting service)

## The 80/20 Rule for Credit Scores

**80% of your score improvement** will come from:
1. Optimizing credit utilization (under 10%)
2. Never missing payments (set autopay)

**The remaining 20%** comes from:
3. Building credit age (keep old accounts open)
4. Limiting new inquiries
5. Maintaining credit mix

**Focus on the big two first.** Most people can get from 650 to 750+ just by nailing utilization and payments.

## How to Check Which Factors Are Hurting You

When you check your credit score, you'll usually see **key factors** affecting your score:

**Example report:**
1. "Balances on revolving accounts too high" → Fix utilization
2. "Too many accounts with balances" → Pay some cards to $0
3. "Length of credit history too short" → Keep old accounts open, consider authorized user
4. "Too many recent inquiries" → Stop applying for credit

**Prioritize fixing factors in this order:**
1. Utilization (fastest improvement)
2. Payment setup (prevent future damage)
3. Dispute errors (30-45 days)
4. Everything else (long-term)

## Your Action Plan

### This Week:
1. **Get your credit report** (AnnualCreditReport.com)
2. **Calculate your utilization** (balances / limits)
3. **Set up autopay** on all accounts
4. **Find your statement closing dates**

### This Month:
5. **Make payments before closing dates** to optimize utilization
6. **Dispute any errors** found on your report
7. **Request credit limit increases**

### This Quarter:
8. **Get utilization under 10%** (all cards)
9. **Keep oldest accounts active** (small charge every 6 months)
10. **Monitor score monthly** (free tools like Credit Karma)

### This Year:
11. **Maintain sub-10% utilization** consistently
12. **Perfect payment history** (via autopay)
13. **Strategic authorized user** or **credit builder loan** (if needed)

## The Bottom Line

**Five factors determine your FICO score:**

1. **Payment History (35%):** Never miss payments (autopay!)
2. **Credit Utilization (30%):** Keep under 10%, pay before closing dates ← Quickest boost
3. **Credit History (15%):** Keep old accounts open
4. **Credit Mix (10%):** Have both cards and installment loans
5. **New Credit (10%):** Limit applications

**The fastest way to improve your score:**

Focus on utilization first (30% of score, 100% in your control, changes monthly). You can boost your score **40-100 points in 30-60 days** just by optimizing when and how much you pay.
