## What is Credit Utilization?

Credit utilization is the percentage of your available credit that you're currently using. It's calculated by dividing your total credit card balances by your total credit limits, then multiplying by 100.

**Formula:**
```
Credit Utilization = (Total Balances / Total Credit Limits) × 100
```

**Example:**
- You have 3 credit cards with a combined limit of $30,000
- Your total balance across all cards is $9,000
- Your credit utilization is 30% ($9,000 / $30,000 × 100)

## Why Credit Utilization Matters So Much

Credit utilization is the **second most important factor** in your FICO score, accounting for **30% of your total score**. Only payment history (35%) is weighted more heavily.

Here's why lenders care about it:

1. **Risk Assessment**: High utilization suggests you might be living beyond your means or struggling financially
2. **Payment Ability**: Low utilization shows you can manage credit responsibly without maxing out cards
3. **Credit Dependency**: Consistently low utilization indicates you don't rely heavily on credit

## The Impact on Your Credit Score

Credit utilization has a **massive impact** on your score:

| Utilization Rate | Score Impact | Example Change |
|-----------------|--------------|----------------|
| 0-10% | Excellent | Baseline (best) |
| 10-30% | Good | -10 to -30 points |
| 30-50% | Fair | -40 to -70 points |
| 50-70% | Poor | -70 to -100 points |
| 70-100% | Very Poor | -100 to -150 points |

**Real Example:**
- Sarah has $15,000 in credit card debt on cards with a $30,000 total limit (50% utilization)
- She pays down $12,000, bringing her utilization to 10%
- Her credit score increases by **80 points** in just 2 months

## The Magic Numbers: 10% and 30%

Credit scoring models have two key thresholds:

### Under 30% = Good
This is the **minimum target** for a healthy credit score. Above 30%, you'll see noticeable score drops.

### Under 10% = Excellent
This is where you want to be for **maximum credit score**. People with scores above 800 typically keep utilization under 10%.

### Under 1% = Optimal (Yes, Really!)
Credit scoring expert John Ulzheimer found that people with the highest FICO scores often have utilization between 1-3%. Paying balances to near-zero (but not completely zero) can maximize your score.

## Per-Card vs Overall Utilization

Here's a critical detail most people miss: **Both per-card AND overall utilization matter**.

**Example Scenario:**
- Card A: $500 balance / $1,000 limit = **50% utilization** ❌
- Card B: $500 balance / $10,000 limit = **5% utilization** ✅
- Card C: $0 balance / $9,000 limit = **0% utilization** ✅
- **Overall: $1,000 / $20,000 = 5% utilization** ✅

Even though your overall utilization is excellent at 5%, **Card A's 50% utilization hurts your score**. Credit bureaus look at each individual card.

**Fix:** Pay Card A down to under $100 (10% utilization) for best results.

## When Utilization is Calculated (This is Crucial!)

Most people don't realize that **credit utilization is calculated on your statement closing date**, not your due date.

**Timeline:**
1. **Throughout the month**: You make purchases
2. **Statement closing date** (e.g., Jan 15): Card issuer reports your balance to credit bureaus ← **This is what counts!**
3. **Statement due date** (e.g., Feb 5): Payment is due

**The Strategy:**
Pay down your balance **BEFORE the statement closes** to show low utilization, even if you then pay the remaining balance in full by the due date.

**Example:**
- Your statement closes on the 15th of each month
- You charge $3,000 throughout the month
- On the **13th** (before statement closes), pay $2,700
- Statement shows only $300 balance → low utilization reported ✅
- On the due date, pay the remaining $300 → no interest ✅

## How to Optimize Your Credit Utilization

### Strategy 1: Pay Early and Often
Don't wait for your statement. Make multiple payments throughout the month to keep reported balances low.

### Strategy 2: Increase Your Credit Limits
Call your card issuers and request limit increases. This immediately lowers your utilization percentage (if you don't increase spending).

**Before:** $3,000 balance / $10,000 limit = 30%
**After limit increase:** $3,000 balance / $15,000 limit = 20% ✅

### Strategy 3: Open New Credit Cards
More cards = higher total credit limit = lower utilization (assuming you don't increase spending). However, this creates a hard inquiry, so use sparingly.

### Strategy 4: The Two-Payment Method
This is the **most powerful strategy**:

1. **Optimization Payment** (2-3 days before statement closes): Pay balance down to under 10% of limit
2. **Balance Payment** (by due date): Pay remaining balance in full to avoid interest

**Result:** Low utilization reported + no interest charged + excellent credit score boost

### Strategy 5: Never Close Old Cards
Keep old cards open even if you don't use them. Closing a card reduces your total available credit, which increases your utilization percentage.

## Common Mistakes That Hurt Your Score

### Mistake #1: Paying After the Statement Closes
You pay your full balance every month and never pay interest, but your score is still mediocre. **Why?** The balance reported to credit bureaus (on your statement date) is high, even though you pay it off.

**Fix:** Pay before the statement closes.

### Mistake #2: Paying to $0 Every Month
Surprisingly, having a small balance (1-3% utilization) can actually score better than $0. Credit models want to see you actively using credit responsibly.

**Optimal:** Keep 1-2 cards showing small balances under 10%.

### Mistake #3: Closing Cards After Paying Them Off
This seems logical but **tanks your utilization**. Closing a $5,000 limit card immediately increases your utilization percentage on remaining cards.

### Mistake #4: Only Focusing on Overall Utilization
Remember: **per-card utilization matters too**. Don't max out one card while keeping others at zero.

## Advanced Utilization Optimization

### For Score Maximization (800+):
- Keep overall utilization under 5%
- Keep per-card utilization under 10%
- Have 1-2 cards reporting small balances (1-3%)
- Have remaining cards report $0
- Make payments 2-3 days before each statement closes

### For Major Purchases (Mortgage, Auto Loan):
Start optimizing **3 months before** applying:
- Month 1: Get all cards under 30%
- Month 2: Get all cards under 10%
- Month 3: Get overall utilization under 5%
- Apply for loan when scores are maximized

### For Credit Building (Under 700 score):
- Primary goal: Get under 30% overall
- Secondary goal: Get all cards under 50% individually
- Long-term goal: Work toward 10% overall
